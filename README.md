Design and implement a Java solution for managing the orders for birthday-cakes from a cake-shop.
The program allows CRUD operations for birthday-cakes, adding a new order, cancelling an order, finishing an order, creating different reports.
Classes in the repository  allow storing and retrieving data in 3 formats: text files, binary files and relational database.
Implemented a JavaFX interface for the GUI.
